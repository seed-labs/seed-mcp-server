    @brief Represent a ExaBGP router. It subclasses the Node class.

    ExaBGP is Swiss Army Knife of Networking. It is a BGP implementation designed 
    to enable network engineers and developers to interact with BGP networks using 
    simple Python scripts or external programs via a simple API.

    Unlike traditional BGP daemons (BIRD, FRRouting), ExaBGP does not manipulate 
    the FIB (Forwarding Information Base). Instead, it focuses on BGP protocol 
    implementation and provides an API for external process.
